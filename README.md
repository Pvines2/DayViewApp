## Project Structure

### **Folders**
- **Models**: Contains data structures for events and personnel.
- **ViewModels**: Includes logic for interacting with Firebase and APIs.
- **Views**: All SwiftUI views, such as the calendar, event management, and weather pages.

### **Key Files**

## Known Issues

- **Back Button Duplication**: Navigating deeper into the view hierarchy may show duplicate back buttons. This is a minor UI issue and does not affect functionality.
- **Weather Location Accuracy**: The weather location must be entered manually. Future versions may integrate geolocation services.

## Future Enhancements
- **Recurring Events**: Support for scheduling events on a recurring basis.
- **Geolocation Integration**: Automatically detect user location for weather data.
